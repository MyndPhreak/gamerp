            Natural length of the camera arm in world units.
            This is how far the camera will be from the parent when nothing is blocking it.
            
            Typical values:
            - First Person: 0-50
            - Third Person: 300-500
            - Top Down: 600-1000

            Minimum allowed arm length when collision occurs.
            Prevents the camera from getting too close to the character.
            Set to 0 for first-person or to allow full collision compression.
            
            Should be less than TargetArmLength.

        <member name="P:SpringArmComponent.DoCollisionTest">
            <summary>
            Enable sphere collision testing to prevent camera clipping through walls and objects.
            When enabled, the arm will automatically shorten when obstacles are detected.
            
            Disable for performance in controlled environments or for fixed camera angles.

        <member name="P:SpringArmComponent.ProbeSize">
            <summary>
            Radius of the collision detection sphere in world units.
            Should match the approximate size of the camera/head to prevent clipping.
            
            Larger values = more aggressive collision avoidance but may feel restrictive.
            Smaller values = tighter to walls but more risk of clipping.
            
            Typical values: 12-20

        <member name="P:SpringArmComponent.CollisionMargin">
            <summary>
            Additional safety margin pulled back from collision hit point.
            Adds extra padding to prevent the camera from touching walls exactly.
            
            Higher values = safer but camera pulls back more from walls.
            Lower values = tighter to walls but may cause occasional clipping.
            
            Typical values: 5-20

        <member name="P:SpringArmComponent.TargetOffset">
            <summary>
            World-space offset from parent's pivot point to the start of the spring arm.
            Use this to position the arm origin at character's head/shoulder height.
            
            Common usage: Set Z to character height (e.g., 60-80 for human height)
            
            This offset is NOT affected by parent rotation - it's always in world space.
            </summary>
        </member>
        <member name="P:SpringArmComponent.SocketOffset">
            <summary>
            Local-space offset applied at the END of the spring arm (where camera sits).
            Use this for fine-tuning camera position relative to the arm endpoint.
            
            Useful for:
            - Raising camera slightly above arm endpoint (positive Z)
            - Over-the-shoulder offset (positive/negative Y)
            - Forward/backward adjustment (X)
            
            This offset rotates with the spring arm.
            Keep Z values low to avoid ceiling collision issues.

        <member name="P:SpringArmComponent.EnablePositionLag">
            <summary>
            Enable smooth position interpolation lag.
            Creates a soft, floating camera feel as it catches up to its target position.
            
            Recommended: TRUE for most games (gives natural camera motion)
            Disable for instant, locked camera positioning.

        <member name="P:SpringArmComponent.PositionLagSpeed">
            <summary>
            How quickly the camera catches up to its target position.
            Uses exponential smoothing for frame-rate independent motion.
            
            Higher values = faster catch-up (more responsive, less lag)
            Lower values = slower catch-up (more cinematic float)
            
            Typical values:
            - Responsive: 15-20
            - Balanced: 8-12
            - Floaty/Cinematic: 3-6

        <member name="P:SpringArmComponent.MaxPositionLagDistance">
            <summary>
            Maximum distance the camera can lag behind its target position.
            Prevents excessive separation during fast movement or teleportation.
            
            Set to 0 for unlimited lag distance.
            Recommended: 150-300 for most games
            
            When the lag exceeds this distance, camera is pulled to stay within range.

        <member name="P:SpringArmComponent.RotationLagSpeed">
            <summary>
            How quickly camera rotation catches up to target rotation.
            Uses exponential smoothing for frame-rate independent motion.
            
            Higher values = snappier rotation
            Lower values = smoother, more gradual rotation
            
            Typical values:
            - First Person: 0 (disabled) or 20+ (instant)
            - Third Person: 8-15
            - Cinematic: 3-6

        <member name="P:SpringArmComponent.EnableCameraLag">
            <summary>
            Enable separate lag for tracking parent's MOVEMENT (not rotation).
            Creates additional smoothing when the character moves/teleports.
            
            Independent from position lag - affects arm origin point, not endpoint.
            Useful for:
            - Smoothing fast character movement
            - Reducing camera shake during sprinting/jumping
            - Creating cinematic chase camera effect
            
            Can be combined with position lag for double-smoothing effect.

        <member name="P:SpringArmComponent.CameraLagSpeed">
            <summary>
            How quickly the arm origin follows the parent's position changes.
            Similar to PositionLagSpeed but applies to parent tracking specifically.
            
            Typical values: 5-10 (slower than position lag for smoother motion)

        <member name="P:SpringArmComponent.MaxCameraLagDistance">
            <summary>
            Maximum distance the arm origin can lag behind the parent.
            Prevents camera from getting left too far behind during fast movement.
            
            Typical values: 100-200

        <member name="P:SpringArmComponent.UseControlRotation">
            <summary>
            Use custom rotation source instead of parent's WorldRotation.
            When enabled, you must set ControlRotationSource from your character controller code.
            
            Use cases:
            - Character model faces different direction than camera looks
            - Custom camera control systems
            - Decoupled character and camera rotation
            
            Example usage in your controller:
              springArm.ControlRotationSource = eyeAngles.ToRotation();
            </summary>
        </member>
        <member name="P:SpringArmComponent.ControlRotationSource">
            <summary>
            Custom rotation source when UseControlRotation is enabled.
            Set this property from your character controller code each frame.
            
            This allows camera rotation to be independent of character model rotation.
            Ignored when UseControlRotation is false.

            Inherit pitch (up/down rotation) from parent or control rotation.
            
            TRUE: Camera tilts up/down with parent rotation
            FALSE: Camera pitch stays at 0 (looks straight ahead horizontally)
            
            Typically TRUE for first/third person, FALSE for top-down/side-scroller.

            Inherit roll (tilt/banking rotation) from parent or control rotation.
            
            TRUE: Camera tilts/rolls with parent (like in flight games)
            FALSE: Camera stays upright (horizon stays level)
            
            Usually FALSE for most games to prevent disorienting camera tilt.
            Set TRUE for vehicles, aircraft, or stylized camera effects.

            <summary>
            Additional rotation offset applied to the spring arm (in degrees).
            Adds a fixed angle offset on top of inherited/control rotation.
            
            Useful for:
            - Over-the-shoulder cameras (Y offset: 10-20°)
            - Angled top-down views (X/pitch offset: -45° to -70°)
            - Side-scroller cameras (Y/yaw offset: 90° or -90°)
