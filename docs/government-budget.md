# Government & Budget System

## Overview

The government collects tax revenue and spends it on public services, salaries, and infrastructure. Unlike the Federal Reserve, the government cannot create money—it must balance revenue with spending.

## Government Structure

### Leadership Models

**Option 1: Elected Officials**
- Players vote for Mayor/President
- Term length: 2-4 weeks (real-time)
- Mayor controls budget allocation
- Can be impeached for mismanagement

**Option 2: Admin-Controlled**
- Server admins manage government
- More stable, less drama
- Good for smaller servers
- Can transition to elected later

**Option 3: Hybrid**
- Admins set constraints
- Elected officials manage within bounds
- Best of both worlds

### Government Roles

**Mayor/President**
- Sets budget priorities
- Signs/vetoes legislation
- Appoints department heads
- Represents government publicly

**Treasurer**
- Manages government accounts
- Processes payments
- Reports financial status
- Ensures balanced budget

**Department Heads**
- Police Chief
- Fire Chief
- EMS Director
- Public Works Director

### Balanced Budget Requirement

**Rules:**

**Deficit Spending:**
```
Week 1: Revenue $800,000, Spending $900,000
Deficit: $100,000
Action: Borrow from Federal Reserve at 5% interest

Week 2-4: Must repay $105,000 over time
Options:
1. Increase taxes
2. Cut discretionary spending
3. Delay non-essential projects
```

### Budget Transparency
